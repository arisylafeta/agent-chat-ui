# Wardrobe Management System Implementation

## Summary
Implement a complete wardrobe management system that allows users to upload, organize, and manage their clothing items. The feature includes database schema creation, API endpoints, UI components for grid display and item management, image upload/storage integration with Supabase, and placeholders for future AI enhancement capabilities.

## Constitution Check

### Principle 1 (Streaming Graph Compatibility)
**N/A** - This feature does not interact with LangGraph streaming. It's a standalone CRUD feature using standard Next.js API routes and Supabase.

### Principle 2 (Tool Call Integrity)
**N/A** - No tool calls involved in this feature.

### Principle 3 (External UI & Artifacts)
**N/A** - This feature does not use the artifact system or external UI components from LangGraph.

### Principle 4 (Multimodal Constraints)
**Compliant** - Image upload component will enforce file type restrictions (JPEG, PNG, WebP only) and size limits (10MB max), similar to existing multimodal constraints. Client-side and server-side validation will prevent invalid uploads.

### Principle 5 (Config & Auth)
**Compliant** - Uses existing Supabase Auth for user authentication. All API routes will validate user sessions. No new public environment variables needed; uses existing `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`. Server-side operations use `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` for image deletion.

### Principle 6 (Error Handling & UX)
**Compliant** - Comprehensive error handling with toast notifications (using sonner). Upload progress indicators, loading states, and user-friendly error messages. Network failures will show retry options. Form validation prevents invalid submissions.

### Principle 7 (Versioning & Deps)
**Compliant** - Uses existing Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript stack. No new major dependencies. Uses pnpm for package management. Leverages existing shadcn/ui components (Dialog, Button, Input, Select, Card, Badge, Switch). May add `react-dropzone` for drag-and-drop if not already present.

### Principle 8 (Privacy & Secrets)
**Compliant** - No new secrets exposed via `NEXT_PUBLIC_`. All user data protected by RLS policies. Images stored in private Supabase Storage bucket with authenticated access only. User IDs from auth session, never exposed or hardcoded.

### Principle 9 (Accessibility)
**Compliant** - Full keyboard navigation support. All form inputs have proper labels and ARIA attributes. Modal dialogs implement focus trap and ESC to close. Color contrast meets WCAG AA. Screen reader announcements for dynamic content. Grid items navigable with keyboard.

### Principle 10 (Observability)
**N/A** - No message streaming or hidden messages in this feature. Standard API logging can be added for monitoring.

## Gemini AI Integration Details

### API Setup
- **Service**: Google Gemini API (Imagen or Gemini Vision)
- **Endpoint**: `/api/wardrobe/prettify`
- **Authentication**: Server-side only (GEMINI_API_KEY in .env)
- **Model**: Gemini Pro Vision or Imagen 2

### Prompt Engineering
```
Transform this clothing item into a professional product photo with a clean white background, maintaining the item's original appearance, colors, and details. Remove any distracting background elements while preserving the clothing item's texture, color accuracy, and shape. The result should look like a high-quality e-commerce product photo.
```

### Implementation Flow
1. User uploads image and enables "Prettify with AI"
2. Frontend calls POST /api/wardrobe/prettify with image
3. Backend:
   - Validates image (type, size)
   - Converts image to base64 or buffer
   - Sends to Gemini API with prompt
   - Receives prettified image
   - Returns prettified image as base64 data URL
4. Frontend displays PrettifyResultView with prettified image
5. User clicks either "Use AI Version" or "Use Original"
6. Selected image is used in POST /api/wardrobe

### Cost Considerations
- Gemini API pricing: ~$0.0025 per image (check current pricing)
- Only charged when user enables prettify
- Consider rate limiting per user
- Monitor usage and costs via Google Cloud Console

### Error Handling
- Gemini API timeout: Fall back to original image
- API quota exceeded: Show error, allow original upload
- Invalid response: Log error, use original image
- Network failure: Retry once, then fall back

### Future Optimizations
- Cache prettified results (optional)
- Batch processing for multiple images
- A/B test different prompts for quality
- Add user feedback mechanism

## Risks / Mitigations

### Risk: Gemini API costs growing with usage
**Mitigation**:
- Monitor API usage and set budget alerts
- Implement per-user rate limiting (e.g., 10 prettifications per day)
- Make prettify opt-in (toggle off by default initially)
- Consider caching results for duplicate images
- Evaluate cost vs. value after initial rollout

### Risk: Gemini API latency affecting UX
**Mitigation**:
- Show clear loading state with progress indicator
- Set reasonable timeout (30 seconds)
- Allow user to cancel and use original
- Process asynchronously (don't block form submission)
- Consider WebSocket for real-time updates

### Risk: AI-generated images not meeting quality expectations
**Mitigation**:
- Always show side-by-side comparison
- User has final choice (original vs prettified)
- Iterate on prompt based on user feedback
- A/B test different prompts
- Collect user satisfaction data

### Risk: Large image uploads causing performance issues
**Mitigation**: 
- Enforce 10MB max file size client and server-side
- Implement client-side image compression before upload
- Use Supabase Storage's built-in optimization
- Generate and cache thumbnails (150x150px) for grid view
- Implement lazy loading for images

### Risk: Storage costs growing with user uploads
**Mitigation**:
- Set reasonable file size limits (10MB)
- Implement image compression/optimization
- Monitor storage usage via Supabase dashboard
- Consider cleanup policy for deleted items
- Future: Implement storage quotas per user if needed

### Risk: AI enhancement placeholder may confuse users
**Mitigation**:
- Clearly mark "Prettify with AI" as coming soon (TODO)
- Store flag in database for future implementation
- Provide clear messaging that feature is in development
- Or remove toggle entirely until AI service is ready

### Risk: RLS policies misconfigured leading to data leaks
**Mitigation**:
- Thoroughly test RLS policies with multiple users
- Use Supabase policy testing tools
- Implement security review checklist
- Test unauthorized access attempts
- Add automated tests for policy enforcement

### Risk: Concurrent edits causing data conflicts
**Mitigation**:
- Use optimistic updates with rollback on error
- Implement updated_at timestamp checking
- Show conflict resolution UI if needed
- Use Supabase real-time subscriptions for live updates (future enhancement)

### Risk: Form validation inconsistencies between client and server
**Mitigation**:
- Use shared Zod schema for validation
- Validate on both client (UX) and server (security)
- Keep validation logic DRY
- Test edge cases thoroughly

### Risk: Mobile camera capture not working on all devices
**Mitigation**:
- Provide fallback to standard file picker
- Test on multiple mobile browsers (Safari, Chrome, Firefox)
- Progressive enhancement approach
- Clear error messages if camera unavailable
